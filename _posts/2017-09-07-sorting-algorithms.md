title: "Sorting Algorithms: Revisited"
excerpt: "Sorting the data is very important for indexing and searching. A lot of sorting algorithms have been developed so far to meet the current needs of speed."

# Sorting
In the world full of data, maintaining the data is a one hectic task. To be able to get the meaning out of this data and search it, data needs to be sorted. The problem to maintain the data is hard to tackle and requires serious solution. Algorithms play an important role in solving such problems.<br />
In order to facilitate the students new to Algorithms, I started [100 Algorithms in Python](/100-algorithms){:target="_blank"} series. Till now, I have posted about 6 algorithms out of which **five** are sorting algorithms. This post is about those algorithms, as I will pivot to some other interesting algorithms. The ones I have post in my blog are:
* [Insertion Sort][1]
* [Selection Sort][2]
* [Merge Sort][3]
* [Quick Sort][4]
* [Pigonhole Sort][5]
