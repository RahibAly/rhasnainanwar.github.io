Moving into the Sophomore year of my Bachelor in CS degree, I buckled up for more challenging studies. As I'm gonna study _Data Structures and Algorithms_ course in next semester, I decided to make the most out of it. Showing enthusiasm, I started implemented some of the popular algorithms in Python. The idea was to implement 100 algorithms in 100 continuous days. My effort was an ambitious one. I created a [github repo](https://github.com/rhasnainanwar/100_days_of_algorithms) and worked with my proposed idea using IPython Notebook. Due to other businesses, I couldn't continue it. <br />
Now that I have created my personal blog, I'm willing to resume the challenge. From now, I'll be posting the details of an alogrithm on my blog every two or three days, and the code will be 'push'ed to the repo as '.py' files instead of '.ipynb'.<br />
<br />
If you are interested, [subscribe](https://rhasnainanwar.github.io/subscribe.html) to my blog to get latest updates. Also, 'watch' the repository to never miss out on anything!
